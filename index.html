                <p>Hi, my name is Trai Nguyen and this is my journey of becoming a Software Engineer. I have always been interested in designing, learning all functionalities and structures, as well as resolving engineering problems. Hence, I have an Undergraduate degree and a Master's degree in Civil Engineering (with concentration in Structural, Mechanics and Materials) from the Georgia Institute of Technology. <br><br> It brings me immense joy to be able to build web applications to serve different purposes where information can be shared via the internet. <br><br> On this website, I want to share with you some of the accomplishments that I have achieved and the path that I have taken to become a Full Stack Software Engineer.</br>
